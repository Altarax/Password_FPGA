# Password_FPGA
A little program to make a password using a Keypad (2x4) and a 8 seg digit. I'm learning VHDL and FPGA and I need to keep my work on GitHub.
So, It's a fun soft to create a password. I'm publiying this because I want to see my evolution between my first autonome program and my last program. 
So, I'll try to improve this code in some months to see the difference.

## Futur Improvements 
> Display all the number not only good numbers ❌  
> Create an animation if we put the good password ❌  
> Modificate and improve the way I used to code a password ❌
